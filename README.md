# planets-game
This was a project coded in May 2019 for my Programming Basics class. This game was coded in Processing.
The objective of the game is to control a central planet and absorb smaller planets of the same color while avoiding bigger planets. The user controls the movement of their planet using arrow keys and can change the color of their planet by clicking on it.
